This version of libdwarf allocates and frees memory through user-specified functions.

The only difference in the API is that the dwarf_init function takes now three extra parameters:

    int dwarf_init(int fd, 
                   Dwarf_Unsigned access, 
                   Dwarf_Handler errhand, 
                   Dwarf_Ptr errarg, 
                   Dwarf_Debug * ret_dbg, 
                   Dwarf_Error * error, 
                   MallocFunction *malloc_function, 
                   CallocFunction *calloc_function, 
                   FreeFunction *free_function);
