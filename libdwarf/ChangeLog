     * pro_frame.h, pro_frame.c: The code adding a CIE for output
       (dwarf_add_frame_cie())
       was simply assuming that the augmentation string passed in was
       in stable storage.  Now it uses strdup() to guarantee there
       no surprises.

     * dwarf_query.c(dwarf_die_offsets): 'res ==' corrected to 'res ='.

     * dwarf_macro5.c: Fixed DW_MACRO_define/undef
       calls of  _dwarf_check_string_valid().
       Arranged to get the macro unit offset out
       when creating context.
     * libdwarf.h.in: Fixed declaration of dwarf_get_macro_context()
       to get the macro unit offset out of it
       so it can work properly in all contexts.
